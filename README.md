# Drive-Space-Overwrite
Overwrite free space on a drive
Fill an empty hard drive with content/overwrite all free space on a drive
Multiple junk content text files are written into a series of HEX labelled directories
This won't erase existing content, but it ought to overwrite existing 'deleted' data / space to make recovery more difficult
Text is (c) Iain M. Banks - The Algebraist*
Probably not the fastest, or most secure, way of erasing empty space but it'll do for simplicity

Use:
Change the drive path variable ($outputDrive = "E:") to the drive you want to fill.
Change the repeat variable ($rptCount = 16) to vary the file size - 16 gives a file ~100MB in size.
  Smaller files will pack more completely into the drive

*the text here used here is from the book The Algebraist by Iain M. Banks.
In the book the text is found writen repeatedly over the entire storage of a deceased AI to erase it's own memory.
